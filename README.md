  **CA:** `Fo9wJVqWYXEgsG3UKekvK1R7YVewyUGodRfBrmjaBAGS`

  **Chain-Fox** is an **all-in-one automated security platform** for blockchain projects.  
  We unify the best open-source checkers into a single framework, making advanced security    **affordable, accessible, and scalable** for every developer and user.
</div>

## 🎯 Why Chain-Fox

- Security audits are **expensive and time-consuming**.  
- Existing tools are **fragmented and hard to integrate**.  
- Many teams skip audits entirely — leaving critical vulnerabilities in production.

**Chain-Fox changes that.**  
We deliver automated, multi-language security detection that is easy to integrate into your workflow — empowering developers to ship safer code without the high costs of manual audits.

## 📊 Proof of Impact

- **14 advanced checkers** integrated (Rust, Go, Solidity, C/C++).  
- **200+ bugs found and fixed** across real-world projects.  
- Built-in CI/CD integration guides to get started in minutes.
